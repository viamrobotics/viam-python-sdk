.. py:class:: Operation(method: str, cancel_event: asyncio.Event)

   An Operation represents a running operation.

   Every request made to a robot's components will create a new Operation on the server. For custom components built with this python-sdk,
   you should check whether the operation has been cancelled to prevent long-running tasks from leaking.

.. py:function:: run_with_operation(func: Callable[P, Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]) -> Callable[P, Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]

   Run a component function with an `Operation`.
   Running a function with an Operation will allow the function
   to know if/when the calling task was cancelled and take appropriate action
   (.e.g. stop long running tasks and exit early).

   If a timeout is provided to the function, the operation will cancel when the timeout is reached.

   An example use case is if a gRPC client disconnects after making a request.
   Rather than continue to run a task for a receiver that is no longer there,
   the component can cancel and clean up, saving resources.

   :param func: The function to be called with an Operation.
                This function MUST accept `**kwargs`
                or a parameter whose name is equal the value of `Operation.ARG_NAME`
   :type func: Callable[..., Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]

   :returns: The return of the function
   :rtype: T
