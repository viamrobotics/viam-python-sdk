.. py:class:: Pose(*, x: float = ..., y: float = ..., z: float = ..., o_x: float = ..., o_y: float = ..., o_z: float = ..., theta: float = ...)


   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`

   Pose is a combination of location and orientation.
   Location is expressed as distance which is represented by x , y, z coordinates. Orientation is expressed as an orientation vector which
   is represented by o_x, o_y, o_z and theta. The o_x, o_y, o_z coordinates represent the point on the cartesian unit sphere that the end of
   the arm is pointing to (with the origin as reference). That unit vector forms an axis around which theta rotates. This means that
   incrementing / decrementing theta will perform an inline rotation of the end effector.
   Theta is defined as rotation between two planes: the first being defined by the origin, the point (0,0,1), and the rx, ry, rz point, and the
   second being defined by the origin, the rx, ry, rz point and the local Z axis. Therefore, if theta is kept at zero as the north/south pole
   is circled, the Roll will correct itself to remain in-line.

   .. py:attribute:: x
      :type: float

      millimeters from the origin

   .. py:attribute:: y
      :type: float

      millimeters from the origin

   .. py:attribute:: z
      :type: float

      millimeters from the origin

   .. py:attribute:: o_x
      :type: float

      z component of a vector defining axis of rotation

   .. py:attribute:: o_y
      :type: float

      x component of a vector defining axis of rotation

   .. py:attribute:: o_z
      :type: float

      y component of a vector defining axis of rotation

   .. py:attribute:: theta
      :type: float

      degrees


.. py:class:: JointPositions(*, values: collections.abc.Iterable[float] | None = ...)


   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`

   Abstract base class for protocol messages.

   Protocol message classes are almost always generated by the protocol
   compiler.  These generated types subclass Message and implement the methods
   shown below.

   .. py:property:: values
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedScalarFieldContainer[float]

      A list of joint positions. Rotations values are in degrees, translational values in mm.
      The numbers are ordered spatially from the base toward the end effector
      This is used in GetJointPositionsResponse and MoveToJointPositionsRequest
