   .. py:method:: get_end_position(*, extra: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, timeout: Optional[float] = None, **kwargs) -> viam.components.arm.Pose
      :async:


      Get the current position of the end of the arm expressed as a ``Pose``.

      ::

          my_arm = Arm.from_robot(robot=machine, name="my_arm")

          # Get the end position of the arm as a Pose.
          pos = await my_arm.get_end_position()

      :returns: A representation of the arm's current position as a 6 DOF (six degrees of freedom) pose.
                The ``Pose`` is composed of values for location and orientation with respect to the origin.
                Location is expressed as distance, which is represented by x, y, and z coordinate values.
                Orientation is expressed as an orientation vector, which is represented by o_x, o_y, o_z, and theta values.
      :rtype: Pose

                and the second [1] value represents the byte contents of the file.
                If available, a third [2] value provides meshes keyed by URDF filepath.

   .. py:method:: get_operation(kwargs: Mapping[str, Any]) -> viam.operations.Operation

      Get the ``Operation`` associated with the currently running function.

      When writing custom resources, you should get the ``Operation`` by calling this function and check to see if it's cancelled.
      If the ``Operation`` is cancelled, then you can perform any necessary (terminating long running tasks, cleaning up connections, etc.
      ).

      :param kwargs: The kwargs object containing the operation
      :type kwargs: Mapping[str, Any]

      :returns: The operation associated with this function
      :rtype: viam.operations.Operation



   .. py:method:: close()
      :async:


      Safely shut down the resource and prevent further use.

      Close must be idempotent. Later configuration may allow a resource to be "open" again.
      If a resource does not want or need a close function, it is assumed that the resource does not need to return errors when future
      non-Close methods are called.

      ::

          await component.close()
