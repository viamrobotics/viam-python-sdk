   Bases: :py:obj:`viam.services.vision.vision.Vision`, :py:obj:`viam.resource.rpc_client_base.ReconfigurableResourceRPCClientBase`


   Connect to the Vision service, which allows you to access various computer vision algorithms
   (like detection, segmentation, tracking, etc) that usually only require a camera or image input.

   .. py:method:: get_operation(kwargs: Mapping[str, Any]) -> viam.operations.Operation

      Get the ``Operation`` associated with the currently running function.

      When writing custom resources, you should get the ``Operation`` by calling this function and check to see if it's cancelled.
      If the ``Operation`` is cancelled, then you can perform any necessary (terminating long running tasks, cleaning up connections, etc.
      ).

      :param kwargs: The kwargs object containing the operation
      :type kwargs: Mapping[str, Any]

      :returns: The operation associated with this function
      :rtype: viam.operations.Operation



   .. py:method:: close()
      :async:


      Safely shut down the resource and prevent further use.

      Close must be idempotent. Later configuration may allow a resource to be "open" again.
      If a resource does not want or need a close function, it is assumed that the resource does not need to return errors when future
      non-Close methods are called.

      ::

          await component.close()
