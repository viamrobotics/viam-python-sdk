.. py:class:: Navigation(name: str, *, logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`viam.services.service_base.ServiceBase`


   Navigation represents a Navigation service.

   This acts as an abstract base class for any drivers representing specific
   navigation service implementations. This cannot be used on its own. If the ``__init__()`` function is
   overridden, it must call the ``super().__init__()`` function.

   For more information, see `Navigation service <https://docs.viam.com/dev/reference/apis/services/navigation/>`_.

   .. py:method:: get_operation(kwargs: Mapping[str, Any]) -> viam.operations.Operation

      Get the ``Operation`` associated with the currently running function.

      When writing custom resources, you should get the ``Operation`` by calling this function and check to see if it's cancelled.
      If the ``Operation`` is cancelled, then you can perform any necessary (terminating long running tasks, cleaning up connections, etc.
      ).

   .. py:method:: close()
      :async:


      Safely shut down the resource and prevent further use.

      Close must be idempotent. Later configuration may allow a resource to be "open" again.
      If a resource does not want or need a close function, it is assumed that the resource does not need to return errors when future
      non-Close methods are called.

      ::

          await component.close()
