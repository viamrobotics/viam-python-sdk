.. py:class:: ResourceSpans(*, resource: viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.resource.v1.resource_pb2.Resource | None = ..., scope_spans: collections.abc.Iterable[global___ScopeSpans] | None = ..., schema_url: str = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   A collection of ScopeSpans from a Resource.


   .. py:attribute:: schema_url
      :type:  str

      The Schema URL, if known. This is the identifier of the Schema that the resource data
      is recorded in. Notably, the last part of the URL path is the version number of the
      schema: http[s]://server[:port]/path/<version>. To learn more about Schema URL see
      https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/#schema-url
      This schema_url applies to the data in the "resource" field. It does not apply
      to the data in the "scope_spans" field which have their own schema_url field.


   .. py:property:: resource
      :type: viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.resource.v1.resource_pb2.Resource

      The resource for the spans in this message.
      If this field is not set then no resource info is known.


   .. py:property:: scope_spans
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[global___ScopeSpans]

      A list of ScopeSpans that originate from a resource.


   .. py:method:: HasField(field_name: Literal['resource', b'resource']) -> bool

      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
      field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
      be raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
      :type field_name: str

      :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



.. py:class:: ScopeSpans(*, scope: viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.InstrumentationScope | None = ..., spans: collections.abc.Iterable[global___Span] | None = ..., schema_url: str = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   A collection of Spans produced by an InstrumentationScope.


   .. py:attribute:: schema_url
      :type:  str

      The Schema URL, if known. This is the identifier of the Schema that the span data
      is recorded in. Notably, the last part of the URL path is the version number of the
      schema: http[s]://server[:port]/path/<version>. To learn more about Schema URL see
      https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/schemas/#schema-url
      This schema_url applies to the data in the "scope" field and all spans and span
      events in the "spans" field.


   .. py:property:: scope
      :type: viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.InstrumentationScope

      The instrumentation scope information for the spans in this message.
      Semantically when InstrumentationScope isn't set, it is equivalent with
      an empty instrumentation scope name (unknown).


   .. py:property:: spans
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[global___Span]

      A list of Spans that originate from an instrumentation scope.


   .. py:method:: HasField(field_name: Literal['scope', b'scope']) -> bool

      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
      field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
      be raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
      :type field_name: str

      :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



.. py:class:: Span(*, trace_id: bytes = ..., span_id: bytes = ..., trace_state: str = ..., parent_span_id: bytes = ..., flags: int = ..., name: str = ..., kind: global___Span = ..., start_time_unix_nano: int = ..., end_time_unix_nano: int = ..., attributes: collections.abc.Iterable[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue] | None = ..., dropped_attributes_count: int = ..., events: collections.abc.Iterable[global___Span] | None = ..., dropped_events_count: int = ..., links: collections.abc.Iterable[global___Span] | None = ..., dropped_links_count: int = ..., status: global___Status | None = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   A Span represents a single operation performed by a single component of the system.

   The next available field id is 17.


   .. py:class:: SpanKind

      Bases: :py:obj:`_SpanKind`


      SpanKind is the type of span. Can be used to specify additional relationships between spans
      in addition to a parent/child relationship.



   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED
      :type:  Span

      Unspecified. Do NOT use as default.
      Implementations MAY assume SpanKind to be INTERNAL when receiving UNSPECIFIED.


   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL
      :type:  Span

      Indicates that the span represents an internal operation within an application,
      as opposed to an operation happening at the boundaries. Default value.


   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_SERVER
      :type:  Span

      Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other
      remote network request.


   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_CLIENT
      :type:  Span

      Indicates that the span describes a request to some remote service.


   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_PRODUCER
      :type:  Span

      Indicates that the span describes a producer sending a message to a broker.
      Unlike CLIENT and SERVER, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
      between producer and consumer spans. A PRODUCER span ends when the message was accepted
      by the broker while the logical processing of the message might span a much longer time.


   .. py:attribute:: SPAN_KIND_CONSUMER
      :type:  Span

      Indicates that the span describes consumer receiving a message from a broker.
      Like the PRODUCER kind, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
      between producer and consumer spans.


   .. py:class:: Event(*, time_unix_nano: int = ..., name: str = ..., attributes: collections.abc.Iterable[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue] | None = ..., dropped_attributes_count: int = ...)

      Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


      Event is a time-stamped annotation of the span, consisting of user-supplied
      text description and key-value pairs.


      .. py:attribute:: time_unix_nano
         :type:  int

         The time the event occurred.


      .. py:attribute:: name
         :type:  str

         The name of the event.
         This field is semantically required to be set to non-empty string.


      .. py:attribute:: dropped_attributes_count
         :type:  int

         The number of dropped attributes. If the value is 0,
         then no attributes were dropped.


      .. py:property:: attributes
         :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue]

         A collection of attribute key/value pairs on the event.
         Attribute keys MUST be unique (it is not allowed to have more than one
         attribute with the same key).
         The behavior of software that receives duplicated keys can be unpredictable.



   .. py:class:: Link(*, trace_id: bytes = ..., span_id: bytes = ..., trace_state: str = ..., attributes: collections.abc.Iterable[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue] | None = ..., dropped_attributes_count: int = ..., flags: int = ...)

      Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


      A pointer from the current span to another span in the same trace or in a
      different trace. For example, this can be used in batching operations,
      where a single batch handler processes multiple requests from different
      traces or when the handler receives a request from a different project.


      .. py:attribute:: trace_id
         :type:  bytes

         A unique identifier of a trace that this linked span is part of. The ID is a
         16-byte array.


      .. py:attribute:: span_id
         :type:  bytes

         A unique identifier for the linked span. The ID is an 8-byte array.


      .. py:attribute:: trace_state
         :type:  str

         The trace_state associated with the link.


      .. py:attribute:: dropped_attributes_count
         :type:  int

         The number of dropped attributes. If the value is 0,
         then no attributes were dropped.


      .. py:attribute:: flags
         :type:  int

         Flags, a bit field.

         Bits 0-7 (8 least significant bits) are the trace flags as defined in W3C Trace
         Context specification. To read the 8-bit W3C trace flag, use
         `flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK`.

         See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

         Bits 8 and 9 represent the 3 states of whether the link is remote.
         The states are (unknown, is not remote, is remote).
         To read whether the value is known, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_HAS_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.
         To read whether the link is remote, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.

         Readers MUST NOT assume that bits 10-31 (22 most significant bits) will be zero.
         When creating new spans, bits 10-31 (most-significant 22-bits) MUST be zero.

         [Optional].


      .. py:property:: attributes
         :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue]

         A collection of attribute key/value pairs on the link.
         Attribute keys MUST be unique (it is not allowed to have more than one
         attribute with the same key).
         The behavior of software that receives duplicated keys can be unpredictable.



   .. py:attribute:: trace_id
      :type:  bytes

      A unique identifier for a trace. All spans from the same trace share
      the same `trace_id`. The ID is a 16-byte array. An ID with all zeroes OR
      of length other than 16 bytes is considered invalid (empty string in OTLP/JSON
      is zero-length and thus is also invalid).

      This field is required.


   .. py:attribute:: span_id
      :type:  bytes

      A unique identifier for a span within a trace, assigned when the span
      is created. The ID is an 8-byte array. An ID with all zeroes OR of length
      other than 8 bytes is considered invalid (empty string in OTLP/JSON
      is zero-length and thus is also invalid).

      This field is required.


   .. py:attribute:: trace_state
      :type:  str

      trace_state conveys information about request position in multiple distributed tracing graphs.
      It is a trace_state in w3c-trace-context format: https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#tracestate-header
      See also https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing for more details about this field.


   .. py:attribute:: parent_span_id
      :type:  bytes

      The `span_id` of this span's parent span. If this is a root span, then this
      field must be empty. The ID is an 8-byte array.


   .. py:attribute:: flags
      :type:  int

      Flags, a bit field.

      Bits 0-7 (8 least significant bits) are the trace flags as defined in W3C Trace
      Context specification. To read the 8-bit W3C trace flag, use
      `flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK`.

      See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

      Bits 8 and 9 represent the 3 states of whether a span's parent
      is remote. The states are (unknown, is not remote, is remote).
      To read whether the value is known, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_HAS_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.
      To read whether the span is remote, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.

      When creating span messages, if the message is logically forwarded from another source
      with an equivalent flags fields (i.e., usually another OTLP span message), the field SHOULD
      be copied as-is. If creating from a source that does not have an equivalent flags field
      (such as a runtime representation of an OpenTelemetry span), the high 22 bits MUST
      be set to zero.
      Readers MUST NOT assume that bits 10-31 (22 most significant bits) will be zero.

      [Optional].


   .. py:attribute:: name
      :type:  str

      A description of the span's operation.

      For example, the name can be a qualified method name or a file name
      and a line number where the operation is called. A best practice is to use
      the same display name at the same call point in an application.
      This makes it easier to correlate spans in different traces.

      This field is semantically required to be set to non-empty string.
      Empty value is equivalent to an unknown span name.

      This field is required.


   .. py:attribute:: kind
      :type:  global___Span.SpanKind.ValueType

      Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context. For example,
      two spans with the same name may be distinguished using `CLIENT` (caller)
      and `SERVER` (callee) to identify queueing latency associated with the span.


   .. py:attribute:: start_time_unix_nano
      :type:  int

      The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the time
      kept by the local machine where the span execution starts. On the server side, this
      is the time when the server's application handler starts running.
      Value is UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

      This field is semantically required and it is expected that end_time >= start_time.


   .. py:attribute:: end_time_unix_nano
      :type:  int

      The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time
      kept by the local machine where the span execution ends. On the server side, this
      is the time when the server application handler stops running.
      Value is UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

      This field is semantically required and it is expected that end_time >= start_time.


   .. py:attribute:: dropped_attributes_count
      :type:  int

      The number of attributes that were discarded. Attributes
      can be discarded because their keys are too long or because there are too many
      attributes. If this value is 0, then no attributes were dropped.


   .. py:attribute:: dropped_events_count
      :type:  int

      The number of dropped events. If the value is 0, then no
      events were dropped.


   .. py:attribute:: dropped_links_count
      :type:  int

      The number of dropped links after the maximum size was
      enforced. If this value is 0, then no links were dropped.


   .. py:property:: attributes
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[viam.gen.opentelemetry.proto.common.v1.common_pb2.KeyValue]

      A collection of key/value pairs. Note, global attributes
      like server name can be set using the resource API. Examples of attributes:

          "/http/user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.98 Safari/537.36"
          "/http/server_latency": 300
          "example.com/myattribute": true
          "example.com/score": 10.239

      Attribute keys MUST be unique (it is not allowed to have more than one
      attribute with the same key).
      The behavior of software that receives duplicated keys can be unpredictable.


   .. py:property:: events
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[global___Span]

      A collection of Event items.


   .. py:property:: links
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[global___Span]

      A collection of Links, which are references from this span to a span
      in the same or different trace.


   .. py:property:: status
      :type: global___Status

      An optional final status for this span. Semantically when Status isn't set, it means
      span's status code is unset, i.e. assume STATUS_CODE_UNSET (code = 0).


   .. py:method:: HasField(field_name: Literal['status', b'status']) -> bool

      Checks if a certain field is set for the message.

      For a oneof group, checks if any field inside is set. Note that if the
      field_name is not defined in the message descriptor, :exc:`ValueError` will
      be raised.

      :param field_name: The name of the field to check for presence.
      :type field_name: str

      :returns: Whether a value has been set for the named field.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises ValueError: if the `field_name` is not a member of this message.



.. py:class:: SpanFlags

   Bases: :py:obj:`_SpanFlags`


   SpanFlags represents constants used to interpret the
   Span.flags field, which is protobuf 'fixed32' type and is to
   be used as bit-fields. Each non-zero value defined in this enum is
   a bit-mask.  To extract the bit-field, for example, use an
   expression like:

     (span.flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK)

   See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

   Note that Span flags were introduced in version 1.1 of the
   OpenTelemetry protocol.  Older Span producers do not set this
   field, consequently consumers should not rely on the absence of a
   particular flag bit to indicate the presence of a particular feature.


.. py:class:: Status(*, message: str = ..., code: global___Status = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
   programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.


   .. py:class:: StatusCode

      Bases: :py:obj:`_StatusCode`


      For the semantics of status codes see
      https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#set-status



   .. py:attribute:: STATUS_CODE_UNSET
      :type:  Status

      The default status.


   .. py:attribute:: STATUS_CODE_OK
      :type:  Status

      The Span has been validated by an Application developer or Operator to
      have completed successfully.


   .. py:attribute:: STATUS_CODE_ERROR
      :type:  Status

      The Span contains an error.


   .. py:attribute:: message
      :type:  str

      A developer-facing human readable error message.


   .. py:attribute:: code
      :type:  global___Status.StatusCode.ValueType

      The status code.


.. py:class:: TracesData(*, resource_spans: collections.abc.Iterable[global___ResourceSpans] | None = ...)

   Bases: :py:obj:`google.protobuf.message.Message`


   TracesData represents the traces data that can be stored in a persistent storage,
   OR can be embedded by other protocols that transfer OTLP traces data but do
   not implement the OTLP protocol.

   The main difference between this message and collector protocol is that
   in this message there will not be any "control" or "metadata" specific to
   OTLP protocol.

   When new fields are added into this message, the OTLP request MUST be updated
   as well.


   .. py:property:: resource_spans
      :type: google.protobuf.internal.containers.RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer[global___ResourceSpans]

      An array of ResourceSpans.
      For data coming from a single resource this array will typically contain
      one element. Intermediary nodes that receive data from multiple origins
      typically batch the data before forwarding further and in that case this
      array will contain multiple elements.
