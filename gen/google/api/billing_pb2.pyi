    The following example shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
    for billing, `consumer_destinations` is the only supported destination and
    the monitored resources need at least one label key
    `cloud.googleapis.com/location` to indicate the location of the billing
    usage, using different monitored resources between monitoring and billing is
    recommended so they can be evolved independently:
