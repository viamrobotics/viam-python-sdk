    the data.  Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time
    series in the set is _aligned_ to the same time interval boundaries, then the
    set of time series is optionally _reduced_ in number.

    Alignment consists of applying the `per_series_aligner` operation
    to each time series after its data has been divided into regular
    `alignment_period` time intervals. This process takes _all_ of the data
    points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as
    averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single
    data point per period.

    Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be
    combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
    transformations. Reduction involves applying a `cross_series_reducer` to
    all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
    `group_by_fields`, and applying the reducer to each subset.

    The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from
    multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into
    a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the
    95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This
    representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the
    individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more
