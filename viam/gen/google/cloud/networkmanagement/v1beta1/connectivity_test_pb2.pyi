        You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
        (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify
        the source location.

        Examples:
        If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud
        Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC
        network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its
        internal IP address and VPC network information.

        If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must
        provide the destination VPC network.

        If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
        network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the
        endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network.

        A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is

        Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
        location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
        endpoint from route information.

        If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
