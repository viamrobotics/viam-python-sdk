    An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network
    service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of
    an HTTP response.

    Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as
    a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type becomes the
    attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example,
    the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.

    This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change.
    So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems.

    NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please
    verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated
